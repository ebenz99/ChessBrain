# ChessBrain

A web app for learning chess traps more quickly

## The Bold, Untold Story

Stranded in the Kentucky wilderness in the middle of the pandemic, three friends knew they could do only one thing--play chess. We turned to chess traps for even more entertainment, and to learn them faster, we built this web app. Using ChessBrain, you can create new traps and walk through old ones with ease. Simply make moves on the chess board and the decision-tree style backend will return trap possibilities playable for either side.
